		<div class="effects">
			<h2>Atmospheric Effects of Deforestation:</h2>
			<p>
				Forests are carbon sinks that sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in its
				place. The rainforests of South America are responsible for 20% of Earth’s breathable oxygen. As trees
				are cut down, the carbon dioxide they have sequestered is subsequently released back into the
				atmosphere, increasing the quantity of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.

		<div class="effects">
			<h2>Atmospheric Water:</h2>
			<p>
				Trees help control the level of water found in the atmosphere. As trees are cut down, there is less
				water in the air to return to the soil. The result of deforestation is dryer soil that eventually will
				no longer support agriculture or cattle ranching.
			</p>

		<div class="effects">
			<h2>Loss of Habitat:</h2>
			<p>
				Eighty percent of Earth’s known animal and plant species reside in forests. Forest trees provide
				shelter, while the canopy helps regulate light and temperatures. As these trees are removed, temperature
				variations, increased sunlight, and vulnerability could prove fatal for all forest plant and animal
				species. This loss of habitat can result in the endangerment or extinction of known species, and more
				tragically, the loss of unknown species.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="effects">
			<h2>Flooding and Soil Erosion:</h2>
			<p>
				Underground, tree, shrub, brush, and grassroots all work together to prevent soil erosion. Without
				trees, precious topsoil erodes and washes away, leaving the land sterile and more prone to flooding.
				Soil erosion on deforested farmland only serves to perpetuate deforestation. As the land can no longer
				support crop growth or cattle grazing, new land is deforested.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="effects bottom">
			<h2>Indigenous People’s Homeland:</h2>
			<p>
				While the effects of deforestation in the urban setting are not yet as poignant, the impact on the
				indigenous tribes of the rainforests are immediate and often catastrophic. Deforestation kills plants
				used for medicine and sustenance, drives away the animals, leaves the indigenous people susceptible to
				the elements, and violently disrupts their way of life.
