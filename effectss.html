 The following are effects induced by continuous deforestation:
</h2>
<h3>Atmospheric Effects of Deforestation:</h3> Forests are carbon sinks that sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in its place. The rainforests of South America are responsible for 20% of Earth’s breathable oxygen. As trees are cut down, the carbon dioxide they have sequestered is subsequently released back into the atmosphere, increasing the quantity of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.

<br>
<h3>Atmospheric Water:</h3> Trees help control the level of water found in the atmosphere. As trees are cut down, there is less water in the air to return to the soil. The result of deforestation is dryer soil that eventually will no longer support agriculture or cattle ranching.

<h3>Loss of Habitat:</h3> Eighty percent of Earth’s known animal and plant species reside in forests.
Forest trees provide shelter, while the canopy helps regulate light and temperatures. As these trees are removed, temperature variations, increased sunlight, and vulnerability could prove fatal for all forest plant and animal species.
This loss of habitat can result in the endangerment or extinction of known species, and more tragically, the loss of unknown species.<hr>

<h3>Flooding and Soil Erosion:</h3> Underground, tree, shrub, brush, and grassroots all work together to prevent soil erosion. Without trees, precious topsoil erodes and washes away, leaving the land sterile and more prone to flooding.
Soil erosion on deforested farmland only serves to perpetuate deforestation. As the land can no longer support crop growth or cattle grazing, new land is deforested.<hr>

<h3>Indigenous People’s Homeland:</h3>  While the effects of deforestation in the urban setting are not yet as poignant, the impact on the indigenous tribes of the rainforests are immediate and often catastrophic.
Deforestation kills plants used for medicine and sustenance, drives away the animals, leaves the indigenous people susceptible to the elements, and violently disrupts their way of life.
