				Forests cover 31% of the land area on our planet. They produce vital oxygen and provide HOMEs for people
				and wild life. Many of the world’s most threatened and endangered animals live in the forests. Over 1.6
				billion people rely on benefits forests offer, including food, fresh water, clothing, traditional,
				medicine and shelter.

				With the world growing at a pace hard to match, the increasing need for space is turning out to be an
				area of concern. With a desperate need for land for agricultural, industrial and most importantly, urban
				requirements to contain cities and their growing population, a direct action that we have come to
				recognize as “Deforestation” occurs. Over the last century, the forest cover around the globe has been
				significantly compromised, leaving the green cover down to an all-time low of about 30 percent.
				According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), an estimated 18 million acres
				(7.3 million hectares) of forest are lost each year.
