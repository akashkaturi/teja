		<h1>CAUSES FOR WHY FORESTS ARE DESTROYED</h1>

		<p class="headp">Causes can either be Direct or Indirect.</p>
		<ul list-style="disc">
			<li>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>Among direct causes are:</h2>
					<p>
						Natural causes as hurricanes, fires, parasites and floods Human activities as agricultural
						expansion, cattle breeding, timber extraction, mining, oil extraction, dam construction and
						infrastructure development.

				</div>
			</li>

			<li>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>Among indirect causes are:</h2>

					<p>
						Insufficient political actions and governance failure as inadequate land tenure system,
						corruption, wrong public administration investments Political and socio-economic causes as
						population growth, military conflicts and climatic changes.The main causes of deforestation can
						actually be lead back especially to: cultivations and breeding timber extraction firewood
						collection road and infrastrucutre construction
					</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<div class="content">
							<h2>Cultivations and livestock farming</h2>
							<p>
								We should consider, infact, that with regards to the substitution of forest areas with
								cultivations and livestock farms, the impact is much higher because after the extraction
								of the most precious trees which are destined for timber commercialization, forests are
								set on fire causing a great impact on local animals and plants. The most disastrous year
								for the Amazon forest has been 1991 when over 50,000 fires where registered by aerial
								views or satellite images.
							</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div class="content">
							<h2>Timber extraction</h2>
							<p>
								Centuries-old trees are cut down to make timber or cellulose for the furniture or paper
								industry. Any system employed for wood cutting causes serious damage to the ecosystem,
								and these damages are amplified by construction of roads required for vehicles and to
								trasport chopped timber to its destination. For this reason, also many other
								economically unattractive trees which have an important biological and ecological value
								are are cut down.

					</li>

					<li>
						<div class="content">
							<h2>Road Construction</h2>

							<p>
								Besides the construction of roads to transport timber, also dam construction and
								industrial exploitation of mines contribute to massive deforestation Also timber, which
								is employed for buildings or furniture, is a carbon reservoir. Building materials used
								as an alternative to timber as plastic materials, aluminium and cement, require great
								quantity of fossil fuels for their processing. For this reason, substituting these
								building materials with timber and employing wood fuels as an alternative to petroleum,
								coal and natural gas effectively contributes to the reduction of carbon dioxide. Even
								if, during combustion, firewood and forest biomasses release stored carbon dioxide in
								the air, if they come from forests which are managed sustainably, emissions can be
								compensated by reforestation

						<div class="content">
							<h2>FIRES</h2>
							<p>
								Fires are a natural and beneficial element of many forest landscapes, but they are
								problematic when they occur in the wrong place, at the wrong frequency or at the wrong
								severity. Each year, millions of acres of forest around the world are destroyed or
								degraded by fire. The same amount is lost to logging and agriculture combined. Fire is
								often used as a way to clear land for other uses such as planting crops. These fires not
								only alter the structure and composition of forests, but they can open up forests to
								invasive species, threaten biological diversity, alter water cycles and soil fertility,
								and destroy the livelihoods of the people who live in and around the forests.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>INCREASED SOIL EROSION</h2>
							<p>
								Without trees to anchor fertile soil, erosion can occur and sweep the land into rivers.
								The agricultural plants that often replace the trees cannot hold onto the soil. Many of
								these plants—such as coffee, cotton, palm oil, soybean and wheat—can actually exacerbate
								soil erosion. Scientists have estimated that a third of the world’s arable land has been
								lost through soil erosion and other types of degradation since 1960. And as fertile soil
								washes away, agricultural producers move on, clearing more forest and continuing the
								cycle of soil loss.

						<div class="content bottom">
							<h2>Mining</h2>
							<p>
								Oil and coal mining requires a considerable amount of forest land. Apart from this,
								roads and highways have to be built to make way for trucks and other equipment. The
								waste that comes out from mining pollutes the environment and affects the nearby
								species.
